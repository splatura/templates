Sonoff S26 comes in 6 plug type variants. Flashing process will be the same for each type.
## Serial Flashing

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/#/installation/Hardware-Preparation) page for general instructions.

### Soldering guide
Apply rosin to shaved wires. Solder tin to the flats on the module.(First put solder tip to flat and apply tin). Gently solder the wires.

### Bringing the Module into Flash Mode

1. Disconnect serial programmer and power
2. Press and hold the on-board button - Note: The Button on the main board is not very sensitive and must be pressed firmly.
3. Connect the serial programmer (VCC, RX, TX, GND)
4. Release the on-board button

The blue LED should NOT be blinking when in Flash mode.

## LED State

The S26 has a red LED connected to GPIO12 along with the relay so it's not possible to disable the power button LED entirely. Setting `LedState 0` disables the blue LED when the relay is turned on and reserves it for Wi-Fi/MQTT state only.
